### Working on the Build a COMPLETE React Admin Dashboard App tutorial

I am currently working on the tutorial available at this URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYpCWwD1oz0. This tutorial shows how to build a complete React admin dashboard app using React, Material-UI, and a data grid component. The tutorial uses JavaScript, but I am translating the code to TypeScript.

### Some react/TS notes for beginners
##### Component-Tree
In the context of a React application, a component tree is a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of the components in the application. Each component in the tree is a piece of the UI, and the tree shows how the components are nested and interact with each other.

For example, imagine a simple React application that has a App component and two child components, `Header` and `Main`. The `Header` component contains a `Navigation` component, and the `Main` component contains a `Content` component. The component tree for this application would look like this:

```
App
├── Header
│   └── Navigation
└── Main
    └── Content
```

Each component in the tree has its own state and behavior, and the tree shows how the components are composed to create the UI of the application. When the state of a component changes, the tree is re-rendered to reflect the updated UI.

### Some comments about the implementation of this app, following the tutorial

##### `theme.ts`

`createContext` is a function provided by the React library that creates a Context object. This object is used to pass data down the component tree without having to pass props manually through every level. In this case, the `ColorModeContext` object is being created with a default value of an object that has a single property, `toggleColorMode`, which is set to a function that takes no arguments and returns an empty object.

The `toggleColorMode` function is being used to switch between the `light` and `dark` color modes in the UI. When the function is called, it toggles the color mode by setting the value of the `mode` state variable to either 'light' or 'dark'.

The `useMode` hook uses the `mode` state variable to generate a `Theme` object based on the current color mode, and returns this `Theme` object and the `toggleColorMode` function as a tuple. This tuple can be destructured and used to provide the `Theme` object to the Material-UI `ThemeProvider` component, and the `toggleColorMode` function to components that need to be able to toggle the color mode.

The reason for setting the default value of `toggleColorMode` to a no-op function is to provide a default implementation for the `toggleColorMode` property in case a consumer of the `ColorModeContext` object does not provide their own implementation. This way, consumers of the context don't have to check whether the `toggleColorMode` property is defined before calling it.
